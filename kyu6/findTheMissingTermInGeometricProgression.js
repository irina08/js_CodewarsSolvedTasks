/* A Geometric Progression is a progression of numbers with a constant ratio
between each number and the one before.
You will be given an array arr that contains the entirety of a Geometric Progression,
except for 1 term, your task is to return that term.

For example:
findMissing([2,4,8,32]) returns 16
You may assume the input is well-formed - all arrays passed in will have a minimum of
 3 terms, the missing term will never be the first/last element and the common ratio r
 will never be 0 or 1. However, for all language versions except the JS version, you
 may not assume that r will always be a positive integer strictly greater than 1. You
 may also not assume that all terms in the geometric progression will be positive integers
 so you may have to take minor floating point errors into account. The test cases will also
 allow for potential minor floating point errors except in the JS version.
